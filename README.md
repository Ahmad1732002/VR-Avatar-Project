# Virtual Reality Classroom Project with Kinect Integration

## Project Overview

This Unity project is an exciting venture into the world of Virtual Reality, where our primary objective was to create a realistic VR classroom environment. We also aimed to enhance the immersion factor by introducing a human-like avatar into the scene, driven by real-time motion capture from a Kinect camera.

### Features

- **Virtual Classroom Environment:** Our VR classroom provides an authentic setting for immersive learning experiences. It's designed to simulate the ambiance of a typical classroom, making it a great platform for educational and training applications.

- **Realistic Human-like Avatar:** We have successfully imported a human-like avatar into the VR environment. This avatar adds a personal touch to the learning experience and can be used for a variety of interactions within the classroom.

- **Kinect Motion Capture:** To make the avatar's movements more lifelike, we integrated the Kinect camera for real-time motion capture. This allows the avatar to respond to the physical movements and gestures of the user in a natural way.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local system:

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Unity installed. 

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

3. **Open the Project:** Open the project in Unity.

4. **Import Necessary Assets:** Ensure that you have the Kinect SDK installed. Import any additional assets or libraries required for Kinect integration.

5. **Setting up the Kinect:** Connect your Kinect camera and ensure it's properly configured. Adjust the Kinect settings in Unity to make sure it's capturing motions correctly.

6. **Build and Run:** Build the project for your target platform (e.g., Oculus Rift, HTC Vive) and run it. Put on your VR headset, and you'll find yourself in the virtual classroom.

## Usage

1. **VR Navigation:** Use your VR headset's controls to navigate and explore the classroom.

2. **Interact with the Avatar:** Engage with the human-like avatar using your body movements, gestures, and actions. Your interactions will be mirrored in the avatar's actions.

3. **Learning and Training:** This project can serve as a valuable tool for educational institutions and training programs. Use it to conduct virtual classes, workshops, or simulations.
